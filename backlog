### **Product Backlog: AMC Premiere Finder**

**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025

This document represents the product backlog for the AMC Premiere Finder application. It is a prioritized list of work items, structured as Epics and User Stories, that will guide the development team. Each user story includes a value statement, acceptance criteria, and a preliminary priority.

**Prioritization Key:**

  * **P0:** Must-have for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch.
  * **P1:** High-priority feature for a fast-follow release or inclusion in MVP if time permits.
  * **P2:** Important but can be scheduled for a later release.

**Story Points:** A rough estimate of relative effort (using a modified Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). This is subject to refinement by the development team.

### Epic 1: Core Premiere Discovery (MVP)

This epic covers the fundamental functionality of the application. All user stories within this epic are essential for the V1.0 launch.

| ID | User Story | Priority | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CORE-101** | **As a new user,** I want the app to request my location permission, **so that** I can automatically see premieres at theaters near me without manual effort. | P0 | 3 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. On first launch, the OS-native location permission prompt is displayed.\<br\>2. If permission is granted, the app uses the device's location to fetch local data.\<br\>3. If permission is denied, the user is gracefully directed to the manual input flow (CORE-102).\<br\>4. The user's choice is remembered for future sessions. |
| **CORE-102** | **As a user who values privacy (or wants to search another city),** I want to manually enter a ZIP code, **so that** I can find premieres for a specific area. | P0 | 2 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. An input field for a ZIP code is available on the main screen or a settings page.\<br\>2. The app validates that the input is a 5-digit number.\<br\>3. On submission, the app fetches premiere data for the center of that ZIP code.\<br\>4. An error message is shown for invalid ZIP codes. |
| **CORE-103** | **As a moviegoer,** I want to see a scrollable list of upcoming movies with their premiere dates, **so that** I can quickly get an overview of what's new. | P0 | 5 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. The home screen displays a list of movies.\<br\>2. Each list item must contain the movie poster, title, and premiere date (e.g., "Premieres Thursday, August 14").\<br\>3. The list is sorted chronologically by the soonest premiere date.\<br\>4. A loading indicator is shown while data is being fetched. |
| **CORE-104** | **As an interested user,** I want to tap on a movie to see its full details, **so that** I can decide if it's a film I want to watch. | P0 | 3 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. Tapping a movie navigates to a dedicated detail screen.\<br\>2. The screen displays the movie's synopsis, runtime, MPAA rating, and primary cast.\<br\>3. An embedded video player is present and can play the movie's official trailer. |
| **CORE-105** | **As a user planning my evening,** I want to see a list of nearby AMC theaters and their premiere showtimes for a selected movie, **so that** I can choose the most convenient option. | P0 | 5 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. On the movie detail screen, a list of AMC theaters is displayed.\<br\>2. Each theater is listed with its name, distance from the user (e.g., "AMC Metreon 16 - 1.1 mi"), and available premiere showtimes.\<br\>3. Showtimes are clearly marked with their format if premium (e.g., `7:30 PM (IMAX)`).\<br\>4. Theaters are sorted by distance from the user, closest first. |
| **CORE-106** | **As a user who has decided on a showtime,** I want to tap a time and be taken directly to the AMC platform to buy my ticket, **so that** I can complete my purchase seamlessly. | P0 | 3 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. Tapping a showtime button triggers a deep link.\<br\>2. If the AMC app is installed, it opens to the correct movie/theater/time page.\<br\>3. If the AMC app is not installed, the device's web browser opens to the corresponding AMC website ticketing page.\<br\>4. The handoff is quick and passes all necessary context. |

### Epic 2: User Engagement & Enhancements (Post-MVP)

This epic includes features designed to increase user retention and improve the overall experience after the initial launch.

| ID | User Story | Priority | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ENG-201** | **As a fan who doesn't want to miss out,** I want to opt-in to push notifications for major releases, **so that** I am alerted when tickets go on sale in my area. | P1 | 8 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. The app provides an option during onboarding or in settings to enable notifications.\<br\>2. The system requests push notification permission from the user.\<br\>3. The backend can send targeted notifications to users based on their location for high-demand movies. |
| **ENG-202** | **As a user with specific tastes,** I want to filter the premiere list by genre, **so that** I can more easily find a movie I'm interested in. | P1 | 3 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. A filter UI (e.g., dropdown, tags) is available on the home screen.\<br\>2. Users can select one or more genres (e.g., "Action", "Comedy", "Horror").\<br\>3. The movie list dynamically updates to show only premieres matching the selected genres. |
| **ENG-203** | **As a movie planner,** I want to save movies to a personal watchlist, **so that** I can easily track the films I'm interested in seeing. | P2 | 5 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. A "save" or "star" icon appears on movie list items and detail pages.\<br\>2. A dedicated "Watchlist" screen or tab exists in the app.\<br\>3. The Watchlist screen displays all movies the user has saved. |

### Epic 3: Technical Foundation & Backend

This epic consists of non-functional requirements and enabler stories that are critical for the application to function but are not directly visible to the end-user.

| ID | User Story | Priority | Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TECH-301** | **As the system,** I need to reliably ingest and store movie, theater, and showtime data from our source, **so that** the app can display accurate, up-to-date information. | P0 | 8 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. A scheduled backend job runs at a regular interval (e.g., every 4 hours) to fetch data.\<br\>2. The data is parsed and stored in our database according to the defined data model.\<br\>3. The system includes robust error logging and alerting for when the data source is unavailable or returns unexpected data. |
| **TECH-302** | **As the backend system,** I need to apply a consistent rule to flag showtimes as premieres, **so that** the app's core value proposition is reliably delivered. | P0 | 3 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. A premiere window is defined in the backend configuration (e.g., from Wednesday 6 PM to Friday 11:59 PM of a movie's release week).\<br\>2. The ingestion process correctly sets the `is_premiere` boolean flag on showings that fall within this window.\<br\>3. The logic correctly handles different time zones. |
| **TECH-303** | **As a mobile developer,** I need a documented, performant API to fetch premiere data, **so that** I can build the client application efficiently. | P0 | 5 |
| **Acceptance Criteria:**\<br\>1. An API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/premieres`) is created.\<br\>2. The endpoint accepts `latitude` and `longitude` (or `zip_code`) as query parameters.\<br\>3. The API response is in a clean JSON format and returns data within an acceptable performance threshold (\<500ms).\<br\>4. The API is documented (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI). |
