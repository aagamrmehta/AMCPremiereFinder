**Document Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Gemini AI
**Last Updated:** August 5, 2025

### 1. Introduction & Overview

The AMC Premiere Finder is a mobile application designed to solve a specific problem for avid moviegoers: easily discovering and planning for movie premiere events at their local AMC Theatres. Currently, finding premiere night showtimes, especially for early fan events or Thursday night previews, requires manually searching the AMC website or app, filtering by date, and cross-referencing multiple theaters. This process is cumbersome.

This app will provide a streamlined, location-aware experience, aggregating all upcoming movie premieres at nearby AMC locations into a single, user-friendly interface. The core value proposition is **convenience and discovery**, ensuring users never miss the chance to see a new movie on opening night.

### 2. Problem Statement

Movie enthusiasts and dedicated fans want to be the first to see major new releases. They often attend "premiere" showings, which can include Thursday night previews, special fan events, or the first showtimes on the official release day (Friday).

The current methods for finding this information are inefficient:
* **Information Overload:** The standard AMC app/website lists all movies and all showtimes, forcing users to manually sift through data to find specific premiere events.
* **Lack of Proactive Alerts:** There is no dedicated system to notify a user when tickets for a premiere they might be interested in go on sale for their local theaters.
* **Fragmented Search:** Users must search theater by theater to compare premiere showtimes and seating availability in their geographic area.

Our application will solve this by isolating premiere event information and presenting it to the user based on their immediate location, saving them time and effort.

### 3. Goals & Objectives

**User Goals:**
* Quickly identify all movies premiering soon at nearby AMC theaters.
* View premiere dates, showtimes, and movie details in one place.
* Seamlessly proceed to purchase tickets for a chosen premiere.
* Receive notifications for upcoming premieres of interest.

**Business Goals:**
* Increase user engagement with AMC Theatres.
* Drive ticket sales, particularly for high-demand premiere showings.
* Establish the app as the go-to utility for dedicated AMC moviegoers, enhancing brand loyalty.
* Achieve a high click-through rate (CTR) from our app to the AMC ticketing platform.

### 4. Target Audience & User Personas

**Primary Target Audience:** Avid moviegoers, film buffs, and pop-culture fans (ages 16-45) who consider seeing a movie on its opening weekend a significant social or personal event.

**User Persona:**
* **Name:** Alex Chen
* **Age:** 28
* **Occupation:** Graphic Designer
* **Bio:** Alex is a huge fan of blockbuster and genre films (sci-fi, fantasy, comic book movies). They follow movie news closely and love the experience of seeing a big film on opening night with an energetic crowd. They live in a suburban area with three different AMC theaters within a 15-mile radius.
* **Frustrations:** Alex finds it annoying to have to repeatedly check the AMC website in the weeks leading up to a big release to see when tickets go on sale. They once missed an early fan event for their favorite franchise because they didn't know it was happening at a specific nearby AMC.

### 5. Features & Functionality (MVP - Version 1.0)

Features are prioritized as:
* **P0:** Critical for launch. The app is not viable without it.
* **P1:** Highly important, should be included if possible.
* **P2:** Desirable, but can be postponed to a future release.

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **F-101** | **Automatic Location Detection** | Upon first launch, the app will request permission to use the device's location services (GPS). It will use this to automatically identify nearby AMC theaters. | P0 |
| **F-102** | **Manual Location Input** | Users who decline location services or want to search another area can manually enter a city, state, or ZIP code. | P0 |
| **F-103** | **Premiere Aggregation Engine** | The core backend service that pulls data (from an AMC API or other data source) and identifies "premieres." A premiere is defined as any showing on the designated opening day (typically a Thursday or Friday) and any preceding special "Fan First" or "Early Access" events. | P0 |
| **F-104**| **Home Screen Premiere List** | The main screen will display a vertically scrollable list of upcoming movies with premieres. Each entry will show the movie's poster, title, and premiere date. | P0 |
| **F-105** | **Movie Detail Screen** | Tapping a movie from the home screen will take the user to a detail page containing: Movie synopsis, cast/crew, MPAA rating, runtime, and official trailer (embedded). | P0 |
| **F-106** | **Theater & Showtime Display** | On the Movie Detail Screen, the app will list all nearby AMC theaters showing the premiere. Each theater entry will display its name, distance from the user, and a list of available showtimes for the premiere date(s). | P0 |
| **F-107** | **Deep Link to Ticketing** | Tapping a specific showtime will deep-link the user directly to the corresponding showtime selection page in the official AMC Theatres app (if installed) or to the AMC website to complete their purchase. **Note:** V1.0 will not handle ticketing natively. | P0 |
| **F-201** | **Push Notifications** | Users can opt-in to receive push notifications for major upcoming premieres or when tickets for a highly anticipated movie go on sale in their area. | P1 |
| **F-202** | **Basic Filtering** | Allow users to filter the premiere list by genre (e.g., Action, Comedy, Horror) to narrow down results. | P1 |
| **F-301** | **User Watchlist** | Allow users to "star" or "save" movies they are interested in, creating a personalized watchlist. | P2 |

### 6. Design & UX Wireframes (Conceptual)

* **Screen 1: Onboarding / Location Permission:** A simple screen explaining why location access is needed, with "Allow Access" and "Enter Manually" options.
* **Screen 2: Home Screen:** A clean, image-forward vertical feed. Each card has a movie poster, title, and premiere date (e.g., "Premieres Thursday, October 23"). A search icon in the top bar allows for manual location change.
* **Screen 3: Movie Detail Screen:** Large hero image/poster at the top, followed by Trailer, Synopsis, and other details. Below this is the "Local Premieres" section, listing theaters and showtimes.
    * Example entry:
        * **AMC Metreon 16** (2.1 miles away)
        * Thursday, Oct 23: **7:00 PM**, **7:45 PM** (Dolby Cinema), **10:15 PM**

### 7. Technical Considerations & Dependencies

* **Data Source:** The viability of this app is critically dependent on access to AMC's movie and showtime data.
    * **Ideal:** Access to a private or public partner API from AMC.
    * **Alternative:** A robust web scraping solution. This is less reliable and subject to breaking if the AMC website structure changes. This represents the single biggest project risk.
* **Platform:** The app should be developed for both iOS and Android. A cross-platform framework like `React Native` or `Flutter` is recommended to expedite development for V1.0.
* **Location Services:** Must use native iOS (`Core Location`) and Android (`LocationServices`) APIs for accurate and battery-efficient location tracking.
* **Definition of "Premiere":** The backend logic must be well-defined to correctly identify premiere events, distinguishing them from regular showtimes later in a movie's run. We will define the premiere window as Wednesday 6 PM through Friday 11:59 PM of the release week.

### 8. Success Metrics (KPIs)

* **User Acquisition:** Number of app downloads.
* **Activation:** Percentage of users who grant location permission or enter a location.
* **Engagement:**
    * Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU).
    * Session duration and number of movie detail screens viewed per session.
* **Conversion:** Click-Through Rate (CTR) on showtime links that lead to the AMC app/website.
* **Retention:**
    * Percentage of users who opt-in for push notifications.
    * Week 1 and Month 1 user retention rate.
* **Qualitative:** App Store ratings and reviews.

### 9. Future Scope (Post-MVP)

* **V1.1:**
    * Support for additional theater chains (e.g., Regal, Cinemark) to broaden appeal.
    * Advanced Filtering: By format (IMAX, Dolby Cinema), rating, etc.
* **V2.0:**
    * **Native Ticketing:** Full integration with a ticketing provider (if possible) to allow in-app seat selection and purchase.
    * **Social Features:** Share premiere plans with friends; see which friends are interested in the same movie.
    * **Personalized Recommendations:** AI-driven suggestions based on a user's viewing history and watchlist.

### 10. Assumptions & Open Questions

* **Assumption:** We can gain reliable, real-time access to AMC's showtime data.
* **Assumption:** A "premiere-focused" app is a sufficiently compelling niche to attract a dedicated user base.
* **Open Question:** What is the precise search radius to use for "nearby" theaters? Should this be user-configurable? (Initial proposal: 15 miles, non-configurable for MVP).
* **Open Question:** How will we handle sold-out showtimes? (Initial proposal: Grey them out or hide them).
